STEP 2. RUNNING QUERIES AND UNDERSTANDING EXPLAIN PLANS 

----
QUESTION 3: What similarities do you see in the explain plains for these 3 queries?

The simple sequential scan plan, "Seq Scan", is used in each of the three queries. The first query does not have a WHERE clause to filter, thus it will look at every row in the customer table. Query 2 and query 3 plans break down into using the simple sequential scan plan on every index of the payment table as it is indexed by payment date. Every row in every index still needs to be compared against the filters in both WHERE clauses. Thus, the time estimate for query 2 and 3 are the same given every row gets reviewed.

QUESTION 4: What is the difference between the plans for the Partitioned table and the union query? Why do you think this difference exists?

The two queries have the same results but the first, using a partitioned table, is considerable slower. Both queries need to group by customer_id and the plan for this requires as aggregate hash function to group the combined records returned from the filters. The first query has an additional hash aggregate function that appears to contribute to the additional cost estimate of the query. The additional hash aggregate function is likely due to the union operator when bringing together the two result sets.

EXPLAIN
SELECT u.customer_id, sum(u.amount) from (
  SELECT *
  FROM payment_p2007_01
  UNION
  SELECT *
  FROM payment_p2007_02
)u
WHERE u.payment_date <= '2007-02-01 00:00:00'::timestamp without time zone
GROUP BY u.customer_id;

QUESTION 5: What join algorithm is used for the inner join?
     
A hash join is used by postgres to execute the inner join. This is significantly more cost effective than the nested loop join as seen in the EXPLAIN results below. The hash join minimizes the number of times table rows have to be scanned. It looks as though the customer table is hashed first, then joined with the payment table.

SELECT customer.customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, amount, payment_date
FROM customer
INNER JOIN payment ON payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id;
